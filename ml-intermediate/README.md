# Intermediate Machine Learning Workshop

## Description

 Advance your knowledge of machine learning! In “Intermediate/Topics in Machine Learning,” we will continue to introduce the model training process, and cover parameter search, model evaluation, and more. We’ll also introduce new learning algorithms from a theoretical perspective. Previous attendance at an Introduction to ML workshop is encouraged, but not required.

### Part Two

For this section, you have options! If you'd like to follow along a guided introduction to two more important ML models, support vector machines (SVM) and principle component analysis (PCA):

If you'd like to implement a new training pipeline on your own, consider building on the Septa Regional Rail dataset for summer 2016. Here's a notebook with some feature engineering in place to get you started:
